This is my project for Computer Programming 1 
Bachelor's degree, first semester in Computer Science Bilingual

This game is inspired by like a rocket shooter game or called "space invader"
Hope you guys enjoy it, but if someone will take it further, I'd be more than happy to do so, but copying code is not allowed!

Hope Copper makes fun for everyone.  

P.S. Score is still bugged in save data.
